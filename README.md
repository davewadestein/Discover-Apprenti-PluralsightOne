# Discover-Apprenti-PluralsightOne

## "Let's slow this bird down"
* survey makes it clear that I've been going too fast, at least for some of you
* I propose we review and do more exercises with variables and if statements, then come back to loops
  
## Week 1 Survey
* https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KRKZC6V
  
## Answer to Question about Assessments
* The knowledge checks are only three times during the program:
  * After week 5
  * After week 9
  * After week 16
* They're on survey monkey, so when the time comes, we'll give the link to the instructor to deliver in class
* There will be some Skill IQs, but the first one isn't due until August 19th. They'll get more information next week about that...
